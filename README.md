# CSO-Materials

These materials include policies, standards, guidelines, advisories, risk assessment materials and other items of use for CSOs working to create or augment their security programs. These are tailored toward government agencies as that's where they come from. but the hope is that they are useful to all.  These are sanitized and can be reused or changed in any manner.
